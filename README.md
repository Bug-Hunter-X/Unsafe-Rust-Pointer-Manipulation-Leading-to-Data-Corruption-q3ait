This repository showcases a common error in unsafe Rust code: direct manipulation of vector contents through a raw pointer.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, demonstrating how modifying a vector via its raw pointer can lead to undefined behavior.  The solution in `bugSolution.rs` provides a safer and more idiomatic approach, highlighting the importance of careful memory management in unsafe contexts.  This example serves as a reminder that unsafe Rust code requires meticulous attention to detail to ensure memory safety and data integrity.
